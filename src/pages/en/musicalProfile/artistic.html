          <h2>Biography</h2>

          <p id="first_p">
            Juan Ramón Mateos (January 2000) defines himself under the alias <strong>Givann</strong> as a composer,
            producer, and visual artist born in the Andalusian city of Córdoba, Spain.

          <p>
            <em>"The desire to express myself through music is practically an innate instinct engraved in the deepest part
              of my being."</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            This reality, combined with the continuous interest in understanding and dissecting melodies and sounds from
            different genres, led Juan Ramón to become interested in music and receive basic musical training at the age
            of 14. During those years, he took guitar, piano, and music theory classes at a music academy in his hometown,
            but it wasn't until 2016 when he started using digital audio workstations and specialized composition
            software. In 2018, the year he began his university studies in Madrid, he left the academy and began exploring
            the world of music self-taught, delving into sounds and musical resources.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since then, he has participated in several independent audiovisual and theatrical projects as a composer and
            has been awarded on multiple occasions, such as at the Daganzo Trascámara film festival for his collaborative
            work <a
              href="https://soundcloud.com/juanramonmateos/sets/flores-bso?si=d46586a9e95f400c9b6d6216eae37f24&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing">Flores</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the musical world, he has also had the opportunity to work as a sound engineer in four university events
            (2020, 2021, and 2022), where he performed various tasks such as microphone setup, stage cabling, live sound
            engineering (using professional audio equipment), directing and coordinating work teams, recording and
            post-producing concerts for subsequent publication on social media, among others.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, Juan Ramón is currently working on his first studio album, inspired by his career as a producer
            and sound enthusiast, heavily influenced by great composers of the new age, film soundtracks, and electronic
            music. This album will involve extensive multitrack audio mixing but is also designed to be performed live.
          </p>
          <p>
            His comfort in working closely with directors and audiovisual producers allows him to create soundtracks that
            faithfully adapt to the ideas and inspirations of the authors, developing creations that merge seamlessly with
            the works and evoke the desired emotions.

          <h2>Work Method</h2>
          <p id="first_p">
            Through his dedication and thirst for knowledge in the world of sound, Juan Ramón has found his path in music
            production.
          </p>
          <figure class="foto_perfil">

          <p>
            Starting from sound libraries created from scratch and sounds generated by physical synthesizers, each project
            can follow a unique development method. This allows Juan Ramón to feel comfortable working under different
            demands and circumstances, feeling capable of tackling almost any genre.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to physical synthesizers, he has turned his studio into a place for virtual synthesizers, where
            versatility combines with imagination in exploring different plugins and synthesis software to unlock an
            unlimited world of sound possibilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every track and every layer of sound is meticulously designed during the production process. Juan Ramón seeks
            perfection in every adjustment, from bass lines to the subtlest details of ambient elements, always aiming for
            balance and harmony in his works.
          </p>
          <p>
            What stands out the most is how he uses technology: not as an end in itself, but as a means to express his
            creativity and artistic vision. Each synthesizer, whether physical or virtual, is a strategic tool in his
            relentless pursuit of sound excellence.
          </p>
          <p>
            His productions are not just songs; they are sound experiences that lead listeners to emotional landscapes,
            crafted with meticulousness and passion. Juan Ramón stands out not only for his technical ability but also for
            his ability to evoke and captivate through the magic of music.
